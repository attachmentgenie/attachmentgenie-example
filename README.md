## Overview

A one-maybe-two sentence summary of what the module does/what problem it solves.
This is your 30 second elevator pitch for your module. Consider including
OS/Puppet version it works with.

## Module Description

If applicable, this section should have a brief description of the technology
the module integrates with and what that integration enables. This section
should answer the questions: "What does this module *do*?" and "Why would I use
it?"

If your module has a range of functionality (installation, configuration,
management, etc.) this is the time to mention it.

## Setup

### What example affects

* A list of files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter,
  impact, or execute on the system it's installed on.
* This is a great place to stick any warnings.
* Can be in list or paragraph form.

## Usage

All options and configuration can be done through interacting with the parameters
on the main example class.
These are now documented via [Puppet Strings](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings)

You can view example usage in [REFERENCE](REFERENCE.md).

## Reference

See [REFERENCE](REFERENCE.md).

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc.

## Development

### Running tests

This project contains tests for both rspec-puppet and litmus to verify functionality. For detailed information on using these tools, please see their respective documentation.

#### Testing quickstart:

```
pdk bundle install
pdk bundle exec rake 'litmus:provision_list[puppet6]'
pdk bundle exec rake 'litmus:install_agent[puppet6]'
pdk bundle exec rake litmus:install_module
pdk bundle exec rake litmus:acceptance:parallel
pdk bundle exec rake litmus:tear_down
